    <h1>Invasive Species Communication Roundtable</h1>
    <p>On March 25, 2025, I attended the Spring 2025 Invasive Species Communication Roundtable Meeting at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History. This event serves as a forum for naturalists, conservationists, and green industry professionals to discuss the current state of invasive species management and strategies for effective public communication.</p>
    
    <p>The meeting took place shortly after the opening of a new museum exhibit, <em>Uprooted: Plants Out of Place</em>, which explores the spread of invasive plants and their impact on urban environments. Representatives from various land stewardship organizations in the Pittsburgh area shared insights into their projects, discussing successes, challenges, and future plans in managing invasive species.</p>
    
    <h2>Touring the Exhibit</h2>
    <p>Attendees toured the new exhibit and provided feedback to museum staff. The exhibit featured dioramas depicting invasive plant species that have established themselves in Pittsburgh, alongside displays of native flora and fauna that have declined due to invasive competition. While curators received praise for their work, concerns were raised about the museum's own landscaping—specifically, the large number of Callery Pear trees planted in front of the building. Landscape professionals suggested native alternatives, sparking a debate on whether removing the pears immediately would be beneficial, given the time required for new trees to mature.</p>
    
    <h2>Exploring the Herbarium</h2>
    <p>Beyond the exhibit, attendees visited the herbarium with Mason Heberling, the museum's Associate Curator of Botany. Mason showcased historical specimens used in the exhibit, including a Japanese Knotweed specimen collected in Pittsburgh in the 1920s. He also presented old landscape design plans featuring plants that are now classified as invasive. Additionally, he discussed research from Cornell on specimens introduced to the U.S. centuries ago through ballast soil from ships, a reminder that plant movement has long been a natural process, though now greatly accelerated by human activity.</p>
    
    <h2>The Language of Invasives</h2>
    <p>One major discussion centered around the rhetoric used in education and outreach about invasive species. Some council members pointed out that messaging can unintentionally take on a xenophobic tone when discussing foreign plants outcompeting native species. The term “invasive” carries strong connotations, yet plants do not invade with intent—they simply survive in the conditions they find themselves in. Human activity, not the plants themselves, is the real driver of their spread.</p>
    
    <h2>Nuances in Management</h2>
    <p>Burlton Griffith, one of the most well-read and insightful attendees, framed the complexity of invasive species management through an analogy involving honey and beekeeping. He noted that while some introduced species pose challenges, their eradication is not always practical. For instance, Galanthus nivalis (common snowdrop) provides an early pollen source for generalist pollinators, benefiting both native and introduced insects like honeybees. Removing it outright would have ecological consequences.</p>
    
    <p>Another important topic was the management of hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA). The discussion highlighted the trade-offs involved in using systemic pesticides like imidacloprid and dinotefuran. While hemlocks are a keystone species supporting over 200 species of Lepidoptera, these pesticides also impact the very organisms that rely on them. The conversation underscored the complexity of pest control in conservation efforts.</p>
    
    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>The main takeaway from the roundtable was that invasive species management is highly nuanced. While Japanese Knotweed is often vilified, it stabilizes stream banks more effectively than many native species. The movement of plants across ecosystems is a natural process, but human influence has accelerated it dramatically. This issue has been unfolding for decades and will continue to evolve in the future.</p>
